Set 3600 or 7200

#case insensitive issue
osx could be set to case insensitive by default. It comes to git as well.
In that case, we should use.
*git config core.ignorecase false*
--> Not working. Instead created case sensitive volume in the main disk.
And using symbolic link for shortcut.

#Gitignore
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1139762/ignore-files-that-have-already-been-committed-to-a-git-repository

```bash
*it is safer*
git rm --cached filename 

**First commit any outstanding code changes**
git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m "fixing .gitignore"
```

#Git pull error
 git remote set-url origin https://username@github.com/username/rss.git


##Reset Files
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1817766/revert-to-origins-master-branchs-version-of-file

Assuming you did not commit the file, or add it to the index, then:
`git checkout filename`
Assuming you added it to the index, but did not commit it, then:
`git reset HEAD filename`
`git checkout filename`
Assuming you did commit it, then:
`git checkout origin/master filename`
Assuming you want to blow away all commits from your branch (VERY DESTRUCTIVE):
`git reset --hard origin/master`

#Clean Untracked files
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/61212/how-do-i-remove-local-untracked-files-from-my-current-git-branch

To see the changes
`git clean -f -n` (-fd directories)  
To execute
`git clean -f` (-fd directories)  

#Checkout remote branch
`git fetch origin`
`git checkout -b test origin/test`

#Create a local branch and checkout
`git checkout -b mybranch`

#Delete local branch
`git branch -d mybranch`

#Delete remote branch
` git push origin --delete feature/login`

#Push new branch to remote
git push -u origin <branch>

#Overwrite branch
git branch -f mybranch

#Clean
`git clean -df`
`git clean -df`
git clean removes all untracked files and git checkout clears all unstaged changes.


#Stash
git stash
sit stash list
git stash apply stash@{2}

git stash show 1
git stash show -p 0
git stash drop 1

git stash {command} {hash} //For dropped stash

#git show
git show object
git show $REV:$FILE
git show somebranch:from/the/root/myfile.txt
git show HEAD^^^:test/test.py
The command takes the usual style of revision, meaning you can use any of the following:

branch name (as suggested by ash)
HEAD + x number of ^ characters
The SHA1 hash of a given revision
The first few (maybe 5) characters of a given SHA1 hash

#git diff
diff two branch
git diff --name-status branch1 branch2
git diff mybranch master -- myfile.cs

#git diff stashes
git diff -p stash@{2} -p stash@{3}


#See previous commit changes
git diff HEAD^ HEAD

#git copy from other branch
git checkout otherbranch myfile.txt

#git update last commit message.
git commit --amend -m "my message"(it also works before push)
git push origin -f (publishes by force. Should never use at master)

#git patch the difference
git format-patch mybranch --stdout > diff.patch
git diff mybranch master > diff.txt

#diff apply the changes
git apply --stat diff.patch *check the status without applying*
git apply --check diff.patch *same as above*
git apply -3 diff.txt *If there are conflicts, it uses 3way merge*

#git amend
git am -3 < changes.patch *we can use mergetool*

#Add more changes to previous commit (not pushed yet)
git rebase -i *We can squash the commits*

#git log
git log --follow file.java *to see all the changes*
git log -p --follow file.java *to see all the changes with details*
git log --reverse *see in reversed order*

git config --global alias.adog "log --all --decorate --oneline --graph" *Nice graphical view: a dog*


#Ignore changes to a file that's already tracked 
git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>

#See committed changes about to be pushed
git diff (--stat) --cached origin/my_branch

#git recursive download
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git://github.com/foo/bar.git

#git rebase
git rebase -i --onto master A *Replay changes of A onto (head of master) and updates current (branch) head*
We can create new branch first and do rebase using it.

git rebase --onto oldBase commitFrom commitTo
git rebase --onto A B C
> Take the diff (B and C) and play it on A but checkout the branch as C.
So checking out 

git rebase master topic == (git checkout topic) + (git rebase master)
> Replay changes in topic, on master branch. And checks out as topic.

`git rebase -i HEAD~3`
>Can squash recent 3 commits into one. (works on the same branch). 
	Not confirmed when the branch is pushed -> Probably overwrites.


#rename a branch
> Step 1: Renaming Local Branch
	When you are currently on the branch you want to rename
	git branch -m new-name
When you are not currently on the branch you want to rename
	`git branch -m old-name new-name`
Step 2: Delete the old-name remote branch and push the new-name local branch.
	git push origin :old-name new-name
Step 3: Reset the upstream branch for the new-name local branch. Switch to the branch and then execute the command.
	git push origin -u new-name


#For open source project
1) Fork the project
2) Add upstream: git remote add upstream https://github.com/matthewsamuel95/ACM-ICPC-Algorithms.git
3) git pull upstream master && git push origin master
4) git push -u origin master
5) Open Pull Request for upstream place.
